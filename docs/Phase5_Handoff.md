\## 🧭 Purpose

This document ensures \*\*continuous progress\*\* across daily ChatGPT sessions while preventing context loss.  

Each day, a fresh chat may be started inside the `LLMscope\_Development` project to keep performance and focus high.



Every session should:

1\. Review and update this document.

2\. Commit changes to GitHub (`phase5\_daily\_sync.bat`).

3\. Start the next chat with a reference to this file.

\## ⚙️ Daily Protocol



\### \*\*Morning (Start of Day)\*\*

\- Run repo verification:

&nbsp; ```bash

&nbsp; python scripts\\git\_verify\_phase5.py



Pull the latest from GitHub (if any).



Review Phase5\_Handoff.md and confirm “Next Objectives” section.



Rebuild stack if code or Docker configs changed:

docker\_rebuild\_phase5.bat

Evening (End of Day)



Verify and push all updates:
phase5\_daily\_sync.bat



Review generated log: logs\\phase5\_sync\_log.txt

🧱 Project Structure:



LLMscope\_Phase5/

├─ backend/            # FastAPI + SPC endpoints

├─ frontend/           # React dashboard

├─ docker/             # Compose stack, env files, Dockerfiles

├─ scripts/            # Dev tools, verifiers, automation

├─ docs/               # Checklists, scope, and handoff docs

└─ logs/               # Sync + verification logs


🧩 Rules \& Guardrails

Rule				Purpose

Functional over Pretty		UI polish only after backend passes verification.

Stability Freeze		No feature branches during daily verification.

Refinement Window		≤ 2 days post-feature for UI polish only.

Verification Discipline		.env never committed; scripts enforce this.

Docker Safety			.dockerignore excludes secrets \& node\_modules.

Documentation Continuity	Update this file at end of each day.



🧠 Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-10-25)



✅ Repo fully synced with GitHub (v0.5-phase5-20251025)

✅ .gitignore and .dockerignore finalized

✅ Docker environment verified

✅ Scripts (phase5\_daily\_sync.bat, docker\_rebuild\_phase5.bat) tested

🟡 Pending: Full stack rebuild validation and SPC chart check

🔜 Next phase: Begin Phase 6 (docs/phase\_6\_scope.md)

🔜 Next Objectives

1. Confirm container health after rebuild (docker compose ps).

2\. Verify FastAPI /api/stats/spc output.

3\. Validate frontend LatencyChart rendering live data.

4\. Update docs/phase\_5\_checklist.md.

5\. Prepare phase\_6\_scope.md for next-phase planning.


🧾 File Reference for Next Chat



When starting a new ChatGPT thread inside the LLMscope\_Development project, mention:



“This is a continuation of LLMscope Phase <current phase>.

The file docs/Phase5\_Handoff.md contains current context and next objectives, if ready for the next phase change the title to reflect as such.”



All project files (backend, frontend, docker, scripts, docs) persist within the LLMscope\_Development workspace.

🕒 Update Policy



-Update Phase5\_Handoff.md daily after completion.

-Include one-line summary of day’s progress under “Current Status.”

-Commit and push changes to GitHub with the daily sync script.



Example End-of-Day Commit
update Phase5\_Handoff.md — verified Docker rebuild and SPC endpoint
