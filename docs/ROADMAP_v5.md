## 🏭 Phase 4: Manufacturing SPC Monitoring

**Goal:** Apply LLMscope's SPC engine to production equipment.

### Problem We're Solving
- Factory equipment breaks without warning
- Unplanned downtime costs $50K+
- Preventive maintenance is reactive, not proactive
- No real-time visibility into process drift

### Solution
Real-time statistical monitoring for manufacturing equipment using the proven LLMscope engine.

### Planned Features

- [ ] **PLC Integration**
  - MQTT protocol support
  - OPC-UA protocol support
  - Modbus RTU/TCP support
  - Sensor data aggregation

- [ ] **Equipment Monitoring**
  - Temperature trends
  - Pressure variance
  - Vibration analysis
  - Production cycle metrics

- [ ] **Predictive Alerts**
  - Equipment degradation detection
  - Maintenance scheduling
  - Supply chain forecasting
  - Yield optimization

- [ ] **Research Data**
  - Full session serialization
  - Cross-equipment benchmarking
  - Sustainability metrics (power, waste)
  - Academic publication support

### Use Cases
- **Injection Molding** - Detect mold wear before defects
- **CNC Machining** - Monitor spindle degradation
- **3D Printing** - Optimize quality, reduce waste
- **Assembly Lines** - Real-time process control
- **HVAC Systems** - Efficiency optimization

### Business Model
- SMB (1-5 machines): $500/month
- Mid-market (5-20 machines): $1K-2K/month
- Enterprise (20+): Custom pricing
- Research tier: $250/month (universities)

### Timeline
- **Month 1-2:** 3D printer farm test (internal)
- **Month 2-4:** PLC adapter development
- **Month 4-5:** Beta with manufacturing partner
- **Month 5-6:** Public launch with case study

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Reduce unplanned downtime by 30%
- [ ] ROI within first month
- [ ] 3+ manufacturing customers
- [ ] Published case study
