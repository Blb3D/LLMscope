ðŸ§  Official LLMscope Project Onboarding Prompt

Copy-paste this at the very start of any new ChatGPT thread or to brief a collaborator:

This chat is part of the LLMscope project (v0.6.0-dev).
The repository is Blb3D/LLMscope-Desktop
.

Before answering or suggesting any change, read these two documents:

docs/LLMscope_Phase6_Baseline.md

docs/LLMscope_Context_for_ChatGPT.md

Follow the verified architecture, file tree, Docker configuration, and .env format defined there.

Do not:

move or rename files

alter folder structure

modify port numbers (8000 backend / 8081 frontend)

create duplicate .env or Dockerfiles

Do:

reference the baseline when giving instructions

check all paths against the verified tree

confirm compatibility with Phase 6 before proposing refactors

The Project Manager (this chat) enforces these rules to keep consistency across all sessions.
