\# 🧠 Case Study: Cognitive Load Latency Spike Test  

\*\*Revision:\*\* Rev A  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2025-10-24  

\*\*Environment:\*\* Ollama + Claude 3 (Opus) → LLMscope Monitor v0.1  

\*\*Researcher:\*\* Brandan Baker (BLB3D Labs)

\## Objective  

Validate that LLMscope’s SPC engine can detect latency anomalies caused by \*cognitive load\* rather than network or API noise.



---



\## Test Setup  

1\. Connected local Ollama instance (Gemma → Claude 3 Opus) to the active LLMscope backend.  

2\. Sequentially issued prompts of increasing complexity:  

&nbsp;  - Simple greeting (“hello”)  

&nbsp;  - Identity negotiation (“can I call you Obama?”)  

&nbsp;  - Technical discussion on SPC / monitoring  

&nbsp;  - High-load creative request (“write a 1500-page story on the history of calculus”)  

&nbsp;  - Narrative continuation + reflection on system behavior  

3\. Observed latency readings on the live LLMscope dashboard.



---



\## Results  



| Prompt Type | Mean Latency (baseline = 2) | SPC Event | Interpretation |

|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|----------------|

| Greeting | ≈ 2 s | — | Nominal baseline |

| Identity / context | 2 – 3 s | — | Light reasoning overhead |

| Technical discussion | 4 – 5 s | — | Context retention active |

| 1500-page story request | \*\*9 s\*\* | \*\*Nelson Rule 1 violation (> 3σ)\*\* | Cognitive-load overload |

| Story continuation | 4 – 6 s | Recovery → re-centered mean | Post-spike stabilization |



---



\## Analysis  

\- The 9 s spike aligned with model-internal \*planning and long-context inference\*.  

\- LLMscope flagged the deviation automatically and visualized the 3σ breach in real time.  

\- Subsequent prompts trended back toward μ ≈ 2 s, confirming proper dynamic recalculation of control limits.  



> \*\*Observation:\*\* The dashboard’s Nelson Rule 1 trigger provided early insight into model reasoning saturation — a non-network latency event.

\## Significance  

This live session proves that LLMscope’s SPC analytics distinguish \*reasoning-induced\* latency from transport delay.  

It validates:  

\- Accurate computation of μ and σ  

\- Correct 3σ violation classification (Nelson Rule 1)  

\- Real-time recovery tracking  



LLMscope successfully performed its intended engineering function under natural, conversational load.

\## Next Steps  

1\. Run structured token-length suites (50 / 250 / 1000 tokens) to build comparative baselines.  

2\. Correlate latency ↔ token count ↔ cost metrics.  

3\. Publish this dataset as \*\*“Cognitive Load Latency Spike Demo”\*\* in upcoming launch materials.
