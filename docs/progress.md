📘 LLMscope Progress Log – Phase 5 Rev B
🧭 Summary

LLMscope Phase 5 (Rev B Core) has reached a major operational milestone.
The full containerized stack is now online, validated, and running with functional telemetry, backend stability, and an interactive dashboard.
Today’s testing cycle introduced expanded research potential through performance diagnostics and real-time SPC monitoring.

✅ Completed Milestones
Area	Accomplishment
Backend (FastAPI)	Added /api/system endpoint with CPU %, RAM %, and CPU/GPU temperature telemetry (via psutil + NVML fallback).
Frontend (Dashboard.jsx)	Integrated live SPC (Recharts) view + statistics panel (mean, median, σ, Cp/Cpk). Fixed React Router context.
Monitor Service	Configurable via USE_OLLAMA and LLMSCOPE_API_KEY; posts real or simulated benchmarks to backend.
Docker Stack	Backend (8081), Frontend (3000/8082), Monitor services fully rebuilt and validated.
Diagnostics Tools	Added reset_llmscope.ps1 for fast reset, full rebuild, and smoke testing.
Telemetry Docs	Created GPU telemetry section + Hardware Compatibility Matrix for README.
🧩 Key Findings

SPC chart static behavior traced to monitor loop configuration — fixed via env variable USE_OLLAMA=true.

GPU telemetry unavailable in WSL2 (default Docker Desktop) — documented as optional feature requiring NVML runtime.

CPU & RAM metrics now updating live through /api/system.

System latency data confirmed via manual benchmark trigger.

🚀 Current Status
Component	State	Notes
Backend	✅ Stable	Telemetry + stats API live
Frontend UI	✅ Stable	Recharts operational, router fixed
Monitor Loop	⚙️ Partial	Posts on manual trigger; auto loop rebuild pending
GPU Telemetry	⚙️ Optional	Blocked by WSL2; doc complete
Plotly Analysis	🔜 Planned	Phase 5B deliverable
🧠 Next Milestone (Phase 5B)

Add SPCAnalysisPlotly.jsx for research-grade analytics.

Integrate export controls (PNG + CSV).

Implement Nelson Rule detection in backend.

Begin session serialization (/data/spc_sessions/).

## Phase 6 Roadmap
1. Model Dropdown UI
2. Filtered `/api/stats?model=`
3. SPC Overlay with UCL/LCL
4. Alert System
5. Per-model sample loop
6. Performance Tuning

## Long-term Targets (Phase 7+)
- Config panel (intervals/models)
- Historical SPC storage/export
- Authentication layer
- Marketing launch assets for Ollama-only version
