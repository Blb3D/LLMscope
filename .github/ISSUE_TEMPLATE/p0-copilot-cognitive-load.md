## Description

Update the AI Copilot backend prompts to include Ollama cognitive load metrics (total_duration, eval_duration, etc.) in violation analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Copilot prompts reference cognitive load where applicable
- [ ] Three explanation modes preserved: Technical, Business, Remediation
- [ ] Telemetry context included in prompt construction
- [ ] Analysis mentions cognitive metrics when relevant to violation

## Technical Details

**Backend:** Update `backend/copilot_service.py` or equivalent:

- Include telemetry fields in prompt template
- Format metrics in human-readable way
- Preserve existing explanation type logic

**Example prompt addition:**
```
Recent telemetry shows:
- Total duration: {total_duration}ms
- Eval duration: {eval_duration}ms
- Tokens/sec: {tokens_per_sec}
```

**Feature Flag:** `FEATURE_COPILOT_COGNITIVE_LOAD=true`

## Testing

- [ ] Unit test: Prompt contains telemetry when flag enabled
- [ ] Unit test: Prompt works without telemetry (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Golden output test: Sample violation â†’ expected analysis mentioning cognitive load
- [ ] Manual test: Trigger violation, verify copilot mentions relevant metrics
