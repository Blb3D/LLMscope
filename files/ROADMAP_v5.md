# LLMscope Product Roadmap

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2024  
**Current Version:** 0.2.0  
**Status:** Phase 2 Complete, Phase 3 in Planning

---

## 🎯 Vision

Transform LLM performance monitoring from **reactive threshold alerts** to **proactive statistical process control**, enabling engineers to detect and diagnose performance degradation before it impacts users.

---

## 📊 Release Strategy

We follow a **phased approach** with each phase building on the previous:

1. **Phase 1 (Complete)** - Foundation: Real-time monitoring + basic SPC
2. **Phase 2 (Complete)** - Violations: Server-side detection + alerts
3. **Phase 3 (Q1 2025)** - Advanced Detection: Full Nelson Rules + integrations
4. **Phase 4 (2025+)** - Long-term Vision: Multi-site, enterprise features

Each phase is **production-ready** and can be deployed independently.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (v0.1.0) - COMPLETE

**Released:** October 15, 2024  
**Goal:** Prove SPC methodology works for LLM monitoring

### Delivered Features
- ✅ Real-time SPC chart (latency over time)
- ✅ Nelson Rules detection (R1, R2, R3)
- ✅ UCL/LCL control limit visualization
- ✅ System telemetry (CPU, GPU, Memory)
- ✅ Multi-provider support (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- ✅ Time-window filtering (1h, 6h, 24h)
- ✅ SQLite persistence
- ✅ Docker Compose deployment (<15 min setup)

### Key Learnings
- SPC methodology successfully detects LLM performance anomalies
- Nelson Rules provide better signal-to-noise ratio than threshold alerts
- Cognitive load spikes are **reproducible and measurable**
- Engineers prefer local-first solutions over cloud dashboards

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Violations (v0.2.0) - COMPLETE

**Released:** October 29, 2024  
**Goal:** Make violations actionable with context and persistence

### Delivered Features
- ✅ **Server-side violation detection** - Backend calculates Nelson Rules
- ✅ **Violation details modal** - Full context (±10 points, telemetry)
- ✅ **CSV export** - Download violation logs
- ✅ **Violation log persistence** - SQLite storage with timestamps
- ✅ **Email alerts (beta)** - Send alerts on R1 violations (⚠️ testing)
- ✅ **Slack webhooks (beta)** - Post to Slack channels (⚠️ testing)
- ✅ **Setup wizard (beta)** - Guided first-time configuration (⚠️ testing)

### Beta Features Status
These features are **functional but still being tested** in production:
- **Email alerts:** SMTP configuration works, but template needs polish
- **Slack webhooks:** Posting works, but rate limiting needs handling
- **Setup wizard:** UI exists, but validation needs improvement

**Expected stable:** v0.2.1 (November 2024)

### Key Learnings
- Engineers want **context**, not just alerts
- CSV export is critical for postmortems
- Server-side detection improves consistency across clients

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Advanced Detection (v0.3.0) - IN PLANNING

**Target:** Q1 2025 (January - March)  
**Goal:** Complete Nelson Rules implementation + enterprise integrations

### Planned Features

#### 3.1 Advanced Nelson Rules (January 2025)
- 🔄 **R4:** 14+ alternating points (oscillation detection)
- 🔄 **R5:** 2 of 3 points beyond 2σ (early warning)
- 🔄 **R6:** 4 of 5 points beyond 1σ (trend confirmation)
- 🔄 **R7:** 15 points within 1σ (reduced variability)
- 🔄 **R8:** 8 points beyond 1σ (sustained deviation)

**Why these matter:**
- R4-R8 catch **subtle degradation** that R1-R3 miss
- Used in manufacturing for 50+ years with proven track record
- Enable predictive maintenance (catch issues before they spike)

#### 3.2 Custom Alert Configuration (February 2025)
- 🔄 Per-rule threshold overrides (e.g., disable R2, keep R1)
- 🔄 Model-specific alert rules (different thresholds per model)
- 🔄 Time-based alert suppression (mute during deployments)
- 🔄 Alert routing (different Slack channels per rule)

#### 3.3 Integrations (February 2025)
- 🔄 **Prometheus metrics exporter** - `/metrics` endpoint
- 🔄 **Grafana dashboard templates** - Pre-built SPC dashboards
- 🔄 **Webhook support** - POST violations to custom endpoints
- 🔄 **PagerDuty integration** - Incident creation on critical violations

#### 3.4 Multi-Model Comparison (March 2025)
- 🔄 Side-by-side SPC charts (compare 2+ models)
- 🔄 Performance benchmarking (latency, cost, quality)
- 🔄 A/B testing support (statistical significance testing)

### Success Metrics
- All 8 Nelson Rules implemented and tested
- 5+ production deployments using Prometheus/Grafana
- Documentation for all integrations
- <30 min setup time including integrations

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Long-Term Vision (2025+)

**Status:** Exploratory - Dependent on Phase 3 adoption  
**Goal:** Enterprise-grade features for large organizations

### Potential Features (NOT COMMITTED)

#### 4.1 Multi-Site Monitoring (Q2 2025?)
- Monitor multiple deployments from single dashboard
- Cross-site performance comparison
- Global SPC baseline calculation

#### 4.2 Enterprise Security (Q2 2025?)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
- Audit logging
- SOC 2 compliance features

#### 4.3 Advanced Analytics (Q3 2025?)
- Historical trend analysis (30-day, 90-day)
- Capacity planning predictions
- Cost optimization recommendations
- ML-based anomaly detection (complement SPC)

#### 4.4 Database Flexibility (Q3 2025?)
- PostgreSQL support (in addition to SQLite)
- TimescaleDB for time-series optimization
- ClickHouse for high-volume deployments

#### 4.5 Manufacturing Integration (2026?)
- MES (Manufacturing Execution System) integration
- ISO 9001 quality documentation generation
- Traceability for regulated industries
- Digital twin synchronization

### Why Phase 4 is "Vision"
- Requires **significant user feedback** from Phase 3
- May need external funding or partnerships
- Manufacturing angle needs validation in real factories
- Enterprise features require customer contracts to justify development

**We will NOT start Phase 4 until Phase 3 is proven in production.**

## 🎯 Decision Framework

We prioritize features using these criteria:

1. **User Impact** (High/Medium/Low)
   - Does this solve a real pain point?
   - How many users need this?

2. **Technical Complexity** (1-5)
   - How hard is it to build?
   - How much testing is required?

3. **Strategic Alignment**
   - Does this advance the SPC methodology?
   - Does this enable future features?

4. **Adoption Risk**
   - Will this cause breaking changes?
   - Can we roll it out incrementally?

**Examples:**
- Advanced Nelson Rules (R4-R8): High impact, Medium complexity → **Phase 3**
- Manufacturing MES integration: Low impact, High complexity → **Phase 4 (exploratory)**

---

## 📝 Feature Request Process

Have an idea? Here's how to suggest it:

1. **Check roadmap** - Is it already planned?
2. **Open GitHub Issue** - Use the `enhancement` label
3. **Describe use case** - Why do you need this?
4. **Provide context** - How would you use it?

We review feature requests **monthly** and assign them to phases.

## 🔮 Non-Goals

Things we **will NOT build** (to stay focused):

- ❌ Full observability platform (use Prometheus/Grafana)
- ❌ Log aggregation (use ELK stack)
- ❌ Application performance monitoring (use Datadog/New Relic)
- ❌ LLM fine-tuning or training tools
- ❌ Prompt engineering IDE

**LLMscope is laser-focused on SPC for LLM performance monitoring.**
